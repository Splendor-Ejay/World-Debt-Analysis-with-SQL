# World-Debt-Analysis-with-SQL

It's not that we humans only take debts to manage our necessities. A country may also take debt to manage its economy. For example, infrastructure spending is one costly ingredient required for a country's citizens to lead comfortable lives. The World Bank is the organization that provides debt to countries.

In this project, I analyzed international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories.

## My analysis aims to discover the following:

- The World Bank's international debt data

- Finding the number of distinct countries

- Finding out the distinct debt indicators

- Totaling the amount of debt owed by the countries

- Country with the highest debt

- Average amount of debt across indicators

- The most common debt indicator

- Other viable debt issues
